•	Downloaded csv files of fake news and true news from Kaggle Datasets 22,000 fake, 22,000 true
•	Downloaded SciKit – learn and Pandas for most methods
•	Removed unnecessary column of Title and Date
•	Kept the text (content) of the article.
•	Made a new column “class” with 0 for false, 1 for true
•	Cleaned the data by removing punctuation
•	Split the data into train 75%, test 25%
•	Vectorised the text using SciKit
•	Fitted the vectorisation to the training data
•	Then used two different models
•	Used logistic regression
•	Used decision tree classification
•	Tested the models on the test data and compared the scores of the two.
•	decision tree classification better than logistic regression
•	Added user input to type in news stories and see if they were real/fake using the two models
